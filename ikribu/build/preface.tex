\textbf{Ikribu} were the songs sung during nightlong vigils held in the cities
of Assyria. During the course of the vigil participants read the events of the
future in the organs of animals slit open at the ceremony's start. The liver
--- evident font of the body's blood --- constituted a particularly rich site
of answers. Models of sheeps' livers excavated from a palace compound in what
is now eastern Syria record the exact locations of the animals' organs to be
consulted by magicians. From such song-filled inspection of the insides of
animals emerged an understanding of the future vivid enough to inform the
actions of individuals and the decisions of the state.

\textbf{Scordatura.} String II of the violin is tuned down a minor third to
F$\sharp$4; string III of the violin is tuned up a major second to E4. String I
of the viola is tuned down a major third to F4; string II of the viola is tuned
up a minor second to E$\flat$4. String IV of the cello is tuned down a major
ninth to B$\flat$0 (an octave below the lowest note on the bass clarinet). The
resulting tunings are these:

\begin{tabu}{l l l}
\phantom{M} & violin: & E5, F$\sharp$4, E4, G3 \\
            & viola: & F4, E$\flat$4, G3, C3 \\
            & cello: & A3, D3, G2, B$\flat$0 \\
\end{tabu}

\textbf{Accidentals.} Accidentals govern only one note. Natural signs are
inserted to clarify the spelling of different pitches following immediately
after each other at the same staff position.

\textbf{String contact points.} Five string contact points appear in the score:

\begin{tabu}{l l l}
\phantom{M} & XT & as close to the fingers as possible (without touching the fingers) \\
            & tasto & very noticeably tasto in color\\
            & pos. ord. & ordinary playing position \\
            & pont. & very noticeably ponticello in color \\
            & XP & as close to the bridge as possible (without touching the bridge) \\
\end{tabu}

\textbf{Bow speed colors.} The score contrasts widely different speeds of the bow:
 
\begin{tabu}{l l l}
\phantom{M} & XFB & extremely fast bow (extreme flautando with the bow only very lightly skimming the string) \\
            & FB & fast bow (very pronounced flautando just slightly less than above) \\
            & NBS & normal bow speed (neither flautando nor scratch) \\
            & $\frac{1}{4}$ scratch & timbre with one quarter part scratch (and three quarter parts pitch) \\
            & $\frac{1}{2}$ scratch & timbre with one half part scratch (and one half part pitch) \\
            & $\frac{3}{4}$ scratch & timbre with three quarter parts scratch (and one quarter part pitch) \\
            & scratch moltiss. & timbre with as much scratch (and as little pitch) as possible (though without encouraging subtones) \\
\end{tabu}

Do not substitute tasto for the FB and XFB degrees of bow speed flautando
requested in the score: bow speeds combine freely with the string and bridge
contact points given above. Indications for individuated clicks of the bow also
appear; these result from almost impossibly slow motions of the bow against the
string.

\textbf{Glissandi.} Do not rearticulate note-heads in the middle of glissandi.

University.
