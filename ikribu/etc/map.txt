[B]
> va ricefall (#2);
answers vn ricefall and initiates bcl Db3;
+ protracted single line of bcl arpeggiated Db3;
rhythm characterized by very fast runs with with intermittent sustained
fingerings in between and no silences;
runs through entirety of the color fingerings on Db3 successively;

accelerandi and ritardandi inflect the game of doubles;
bcl transitions from dance of color fingerings to vigil note during game of
doubles;
