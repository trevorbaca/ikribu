(va, bcl tacet);


[B]
> va ricefall (#2);
answers vn ricefall and initiates bcl Db3;
+ protracted single line of bcl arpeggiated Db3;
rhythm characterized by very fast runs with with intermittent sustained
fingerings in between and no silences;
runs through entirety of the color fingerings on Db3 successively;
+ vc takes small stone in hand;
> at end of bcl breath vc plays circles slate to help complete bcl breath;
> vc circled slate continues afters bcl breath stops;
vc brings circled slate to close in slowing time and stopping time;
> long fermata;


[C]
(quick tempo);
> bcl vigil (#1) at B1;
quiet dynamic with rapidly changing hairpins;
rapidly changing hairpins restart timeflow;

+ vn, va begin ppppp tremolo alla punta;
> bcl vigil ends;
ppppp trem. alla punta dramatically exposed;
time has stopped again even with rapid internal animation of tremolo;
> tremolo persists for a long duration while time is frozen;
> sfz cello harmonic pizzicato;

.... vn tremolo continues;

[E]
(tempo changes);

> vn, va game of doubles cycle 2;
+ accelerando ends at end of segment.
> short fermata;
(vc tacet entire segment);


[F]
(tempo changes);
(repetition cell: x6);
    > bcl tries again with circled slate;
    + vn, va finger tapping;
    > short fermata


[G]
> unaccompanied parametric vc window.
+ va silently prepares second cup of rice while vc plays;
> short fermata;


[H]
(type of recapitulation of [B]);
> va ricefall (#3) and then freeze;
+ bcl recapitulates arpeggiated breath but at C3 instead of Db3;
(vn remains frozen in position over BD);
(vc tacet);


[I]
... bcl long breath on arpeggiated C3 continues;
> vn, va unfreeze and resume game of doubles (cycle 3);
> vn, va game of doubles (cycle 4);
> vn, va game of doubles (cycle 5);
> vn, va game of doubles (cycle 6);
accelerandi and ritardandi inflect the game of doubles;
bcl transitions from dance of color fingerings to vigil note during game of
doubles;
> game of doubles reaches point of suspension;
> eventually all that is left is bcl vigil;
+ vn, va retake instruments during bcl vigil;
> short fermata;


[J]
> sfz cello harmonic pizzicato initiates segment;
+ vn, va parameterized window;
> short fermata;

> long fermata;
> vc plays exactly one figure on slate; this slows time and then stops time;
> long fermata;
> bcl begins and continues circled slate;
+ vn, va ppppp tremolo begins again with altered pitch;
> vc joins with shaken rice;
hairpins shape shaken rice;
> combined bcl slate + vn, va ppppp trem. + vc shaken rice continues long time;
> layers finish in staggered diminuendo;
> vn, va finish first in order to transition to ritual positions at BD;
> vn takes small handful of rice in rh and also bristles in lh;
> bcl, vc finish after;
> very long fermata;


[L]
(great welling up of rice);
begins with vn dropping single grain on BD skin;
fermata;
more vn grains of rice;
fermata;
more vn grains of rice;
va then strikes BD skin firmly with BD mallet or palm of hand;
fermata;
more vn rice grains together with vn bristles across BD skin;
va BD strike;
fermata;
more vn rice grains together with vn bristles across BD skin;
va BD strike;


[M]
... previous materials continue into segment;
+ bcl vigil tone joins underneath at start of segment;
halts stop and timeflow resumes;
va mallet strikes on BD skin now slow but continuous;
vn bristles on DB skin now slow but continuous;
combined vn BD bristles + va BD mallet + bcl vigil tone continues for a time;
then begins ricefall;
> vc ricefall (#4);
+ other three players read the patterns that are exposed: faster strokes on BD
skin, tightened tempo, noticeable crescendi against bcl vigil; and then a
release back to previous tension, energy and motion;
> vc ricefall (#5);
+ other three players read the patterns that are exposed;
> vc ricefall (#6);
+ other three players read the patterns that are exposed;
> vc ricefall (#7);
+ other three players halt abruptly in middle of fourth ricefall;
fourth ricefall completes in silence and absolute stillness;
silences counted at tempo;
no fermata after completion of ricefall (#7);
> bcl vigil picks dal niente after counted silences;
bcl vigil continues to end of segment and across segment boundary;


[N]
... bcl vigil;
+ sfz cello harmonic pizzicato initiates segment;
+ vn, va, vc parameterized window;
bcl vigil continues uninterrupted during entirety of window;
bcl vigil rises very slightly during window;
window complets at end of segment;
attaca to following segment;


[O]
... bcl vigil;
bcl vigil continues to rise in pitch during segment;
apotheosis of vn, va, vc tremolo;
entire tremolo process moves from ppppp to fffff;
extensive string contact point transition process;
segment ends at maximal dynamic in bcl, vn, va, vc;
attaca to following segment;


[P]
> sub. bcl pp at start of segment;
+ fortissimo vn, va, vc parameterized window;
window uses complex parameter repetition six times;
short fermata after each parameter repetition;
bcl vigil dim. al niente during entire course of segment;
> short fermata at end of segment;


[Q]
> sfz cello harmonic pizzicato initiates segment;
+ ppp bcl vigil resumes but does not last for entire segment;
> vn, va, vc put down instruments deliberately during ppp bcl vigil;
> at bcl pitch change vn begins circled slate;
> at bcl pitch change vn stops circled slate and va starts circled BD skin;
> at bcl pitch change va stops circled BD skin and vc starts circled rice;
> at bcl pitch change vn, va, vc tutti circling starts;
> subito bcl, vn, va freeze;
> vc circled rice continues some measures longer;
> fermata.
