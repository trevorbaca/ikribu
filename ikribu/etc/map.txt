[A]
> sfz cello harmonic pizzicato;
+ vn ricefall (#1); 
+ va prepares ricefalls silently;
> long fermata;
(va, bcl tacet);


[B]
> va ricefall (#2);
answers vn ricefall and initiates bcl Db3;
+ protracted single line of bcl arpeggiated Db3;
rhythm characterized by very fast runs with with intermittent sustained
fingerings in between and no silences;
runs through entirety of the color fingerings on Db3 successively;
+ vc takes small stone in hand;
> at end of bcl breath vc plays circles slate to help complete bcl breath;
> vc circled slate continues afters bcl breath stops;
vc brings circled slate to close in slowing time and stopping time;
> long fermata;


[C]
first bcl vigil note with some rapidly changing hairpins over relatively quiet
dynamics which have the effect of restarting time; internal time of vigil note
moves very quickly;
short fermata;
bcl repeats vigil note exactly, though is curtailed and executes only first
third of vigil note before stopping suddenly and starting again from the
beginning;
at beginning of third statement of vigil note vn, va begin ppppp tremolo alla
punta for first time in piece;
bcl vigil note ends leaving ppppp trem. alla punta dramatically exposed; time
has stopped again even though the internal animation of the trem. is rapid;
time freezes for long duration of ppppp trem.;
sfz cello harmonic pizzicato rings out clearly over ppppp trem. marking
no-man's land between segments;


[D]
vn, va ppppp trem. continues into start of segment;
bcl picks up small stone;
after some time of ppppp trem. bcl plays exactly one figure on slate, recalling
vc slate previously;
trem. continues;
bcl tries again;
trem. continues;
bcl tries again;
trem. continues but va begins diminuendo al niente;
bcl tries again;
trem. continues and va reaches freeze;
bcl tries again and va puts down bow while this happens;
vn trem. continues;
bcl tries again;
short fermata follows this attempt which also silences vn trem. momentarily;
vn ppppp trem resumes at same time as va BD finger tapping begins for first
time;
bcl tries again;
vn trem + va finger tapping continues and vn begins dim al niente;
bcl tries again;
va finger tapping continues and vn freezes;
bcl tries again;
va finger tapping continues;
bcl tries again;
vn joins finger tapping and vn, va finger tapping continues;
short fermata;
accelerando begins;
vn, va game of doubles cycle 1;
vn, va game of doubles cycle 2;
accelerando ends at end of segment.
short fermata;


[E]
> unaccompanied parametric vc window.
+ va silently prepares second cup of rice while vc plays;
short fermata;


[F]
(type of recapitulation of [B]);
> va ricefall (#3) and then freeze;
+ bcl recapitulates arpeggiated Db3 breath;
(vn remains frozen in position over BD);
(vc tacet);


[G]
material of previous segment continues into start of this segment;
vn, va unfreeze and resume game of doubles;
vn, va game of doubles cycle 3;
vn, va game of doubles cycle 4;
vn, va game of doubles cycle 5;
vn, va game of doubles cycle 6;
accelerandi and ritardandi inflect the game of doubles;
bcl transitions from dance of color fingerings to vigil note during game of
doubles;
short vc OB tugs become sparser and sparser and diminuendo al niente;
game of doubles reaches point of suspension;
eventually all that is left is bcl vigil;
vn, va retake instruments during bcl vigil;
short fermata;


[H]
sfz cello harmonic pizzicato initiates segment;
vn, va parameterized window initiated by sfz cello harmonic pizzicato;
short fermata;


[I]
vc plays exactly one figure on slate; this slows time and then stops time;
long fermata;
bcl plays exactly one figure on slate; this slows time and then stops time;
long fermata;
vc plays exactly one figure on slate; this slows time and then stops time;
long fermata;
bcl begins and continues slate circles;
at same time vn, va pppp trem. begins again with altered pitch;
then vc joins by gently shaking glass of rice with hairpin inflections;
combined bcl slate + vn, va ppppp trem. + vc shaken rice continues for a very
long time;
layers finish in staggered diminuendo;
vn, va finish first in order to transition to ritual positions at BD;
vn takes small handful of rice in rh and also bristles in lh;
bcl, vc finish after;
very long fermata;


[J]
(great welling up of rice);
begins with vn dropping single grain on BD skin;
fermata;
more vn grains of rice;
fermata;
more vn grains of rice;
va then strikes BD skin firmly with BD mallet or palm of hand;
fermata;
more vn rice grains together with vn bristles across BD skin;
va BD strike;
fermata;
more vn rice grains together with vn bristles across BD skin;
va BD strike;


[K]
... previous materials continue into segment;
+ bcl vigil tone joins underneath at start of segment;
halts stop and timeflow resumes;
va mallet strikes on BD skin now slow but continuous;
vn bristles on DB skin now slow but continuous;
combined vn BD bristles + va BD mallet + bcl vigil tone continues for a time;
then begins ricefall;
> vc ricefall (#4);
+ other three players read the patterns that are exposed: faster strokes on BD
skin, tightened tempo, noticeable crescendi against bcl vigil; and then a
release back to previous tension, energy and motion;
> vc ricefall (#5);
+ other three players read the patterns that are exposed;
> vc ricefall (#6);
+ other three players read the patterns that are exposed;
> vc ricefall (#7);
+ other three players halt abruptly in middle of fourth ricefall;
fourth ricefall completes in silence and absolute stillness;
silences counted at tempo;
no fermata after completion of ricefall (#7);
> bcl vigil picks dal niente after counted silences;
bcl vigil continues to end of segment and across segment boundary;


[L]
... bcl vigil;
+ sfz cello harmonic pizzicato initiates segment;
+ vn, va, vc parameterized window;
bcl vigil continues uninterrupted during entirety of window;
bcl vigil rises very slightly during window;
window complets at end of segment;
attaca to following segment;


[M]
... bcl vigil;
bcl vigil continues to rise in pitch during segment;
apotheosis of vn, va, vc tremolo;
entire tremolo process moves from ppppp to fffff;
extensive string contact point transition process;
segment ends at maximal dynamic in bcl, vn, va, vc;
attaca to following segment;


[N]
> sub. bcl pp at start of segment;
+ fortissimo vn, va, vc parameterized window;
window uses complex parameter repetition six times;
short fermata after each parameter repetition;
bcl vigil dim. al niente during entire course of segment;
> short fermata at end of segment;


[O]
> sfz cello harmonic pizzicato initiates segment;
+ ppp bcl vigil resumes but does not last for entire segment;
> vn, va, vc put down instruments deliberately during ppp bcl vigil;
> at bcl pitch change vn begins circled slate;
> at bcl pitch change vn stops circled slate and va starts circled BD skin;
> at bcl pitch change va stops circled BD skin and vc starts circled rice;
> at bcl pitch change vn, va, vc tutti circling starts;
> subito bcl, vn, va freeze;
> vc circled rice continues some measures longer;
> fermata.
